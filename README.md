# 📘 OOPS Using C++ – Assignment  

This repository contains basic C++ problems related to **arrays, searching, matrices, strings, functions, and sturctures**.  

---

## 📝 UNIT 1 - Introduction to OOP and C++

### Q1. Swap numbers
Write a program that accepts **2 numbers** from the user and **swaps** the two numbers **without using a temporary variable**.

---

### Q2. Quotient and remainder
Write a program that accepts **2 numbers** a and b and **divides a by b** and displays the **quotient and the remainder**.

---

## 📝 UNIT 2 - C++ Basic Programing Statements

### Q1. Prime number til the number
Write a program which **accepts a number from the user** and generates **prime numbers till that number**.

---

### Q2. Fibonacci series
write a program that **accepts a number 'n' from the user** and **generates Fibonacci series till n**
> ⚠️ Note: Fibonacci series starts with **0 and 1** and then the **subsequent numbers** are generated by **adding the two previous numbers** in the series.

---

## 📝 UNIT 3 - Arrays and Strings in C++

### Q1. Sequential Search in Array  
Write a program that stores **10 numbers** in an array. The user should be able to **search a particular number** in the array. Implement **Sequential Search** for this purpose.  

---

### Q2. Binary Search in Array  
Implement the above program for **Binary Search**.  
> ⚠️ Note: Binary Search works only with **sorted arrays**.  

---

### Q3. Transpose of a Matrix  
Write a program that accepts a **3×3 matrix** from the user and finds the **Transpose** of it.  

---

### Q4. Palindrome Check  
Write a program to check whether a **string is a palindrome** or not.  
> 📖 A palindrome is one which remains the same if you reverse the characters in the string.  
> Example: **"MADAM"**, **"LEVEL"**, **"RACECAR"**.  

---

## 📝 UNIT 4 - Functions and Structures in C++

### Q1. Structure
Write a C++ program that **implements the stucture** and enables to store **atleast 100 product** data.
> 📖 Define a structure named **product** with elements **productcode, description, unitprice and qtyinhand**.

---

### Q2. Function (Call By Value)
Write a function that **input radius of the circle** and **return the area of the circle**.

---

### Q3. Function (Call BY Reference)
Write a function that **takes two integers**, find out which is **smaller** and then **assigns zero** to the smaller variable and **returns the value**.

---

## 📝 UNIT 4 - Objects and Classes

### Q1. Stack
Implement a **class stack** which simulates the **operations of the stack** allowing **LIFO** operations. Also implement **push and pop** operations for the stack.

---

### Q2. Array Object
Write a program to test the class and **it should store information** of **100 employees**.
> 📖 Implement a **class called Employee** that contains **name, employee number and department code**. Include a **member function getdata()** to get data from user and **store it in the object**.

---

## 🚀 How to Use  
- Save each program in a `.cpp` file (e.g., `q1.cpp`, `q2.cpp`, etc.)  
- Compile using **g++**:  
  ```bash
  g++ q1.cpp -o q1
  ./q1
