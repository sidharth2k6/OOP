# 📘 OOPS Using C++ – Assignment  

This repository contains basic C++ problems related to **arrays, searching, matrices, strings, functions, and sturctures**.  

---

## 📝 UNIT 1 - Introduction to OOP and C++

### Q1. Swap numbers
Write a program that accepts **2 numbers** from the user and **swaps** the two numbers **without using a temporary variable**.

### Q2. Quotient and remainder
Write a program that accepts **2 numbers** a and b and **divides a by b** and displays the **quotient and the remainder**.

## 📝 UNIT 2 - C++ Basic Programing Statements

### Q1. Prime number til the number
Write a program which **accepts a number from the user** and generates **prime numbers till that number**.

### Q2. Fibonacci series
write a program that **accepts a number 'n' from the user** and **generates Fibonacci series till n**(Fibonacci series starts with 0 and 1 and then the subsequent numbers are generated by adding the two previous numbers in the series).

## 📝 Questions  

### Q1. Sequential Search in Array  
Write a program that stores **10 numbers** in an array. The user should be able to **search a particular number** in the array. Implement **Sequential Search** for this purpose.  

---

### Q2. Binary Search in Array  
Implement the above program for **Binary Search**.  
> ⚠️ Note: Binary Search works only with **sorted arrays**.  

---

### Q3. Transpose of a Matrix  
Write a program that accepts a **3×3 matrix** from the user and finds the **Transpose** of it.  

---

### Q4. Palindrome Check  
Write a program to check whether a **string is a palindrome** or not.  
> 📖 A palindrome is one which remains the same if you reverse the characters in the string.  
> Example: **"MADAM"**, **"LEVEL"**, **"RACECAR"**.

## 🚀 How to Use  
- Save each program in a `.cpp` file (e.g., `q1.cpp`, `q2.cpp`, etc.)  
- Compile using **g++**:  
  ```bash
  g++ q1.cpp -o q1
  ./q1
